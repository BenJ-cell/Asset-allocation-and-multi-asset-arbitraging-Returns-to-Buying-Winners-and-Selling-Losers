The article examines investment strategies that involve buying stocks with strong past performance and selling those with poor past performance. These strategies consistently deliver significant returns over short to medium-holding periods of 3 to 12 months. The research finds that the success of these strategies cannot be attributed to systemic risk or delayed reactions in stock prices to standard factors. However, while the strategies generate substantial abnormal returns in the first year after portfolio creation, these returns gradually diminish over the following two years. A similar trend is observed in returns surrounding earnings announcements for previously top-performing and under-performing stocks.
